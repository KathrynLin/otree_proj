        The 3 periods that have been randomly drawn for payment are {{paying_period}}
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore, you earned {{ total_payoff }} from the investment game.
    </p>

    <p>
        You earned {{ player.participant.payoff}} in total which is the income from the quiz plus the income from the investment game.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to that, you get a participation fee of {{ Constants.base_points }}.
    </p>

    <p>
        In total, you receive {{ total_plus_base }}, which is {{total_payoff_money}}.
