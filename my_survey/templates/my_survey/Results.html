<p>
  Recall that you must make decisions for all choices that you face
  before one of the decisions will be selected at random to determine your earnings.
</p>

<p>
  After you have made all decisions and one of these has been selected to be used,
  the program will generate a random number to calculate your earnings for the decision problem that turns out to be relevant.
  Now we will generate the random number that determines the throw of the 10-sided die
  in such a manner that each outcome, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 is equally likely.
</p>
<p>
  Your choice list is {{player.choice_list}}.
</p>

<strong>
  The decision chosen for payment is {{decision_for_payment}}. The corresponding choice is {{choice_for_payment}}.
  The random number that determines the throw of the 10-sided die is {{die_num}}.
  You earned {{payment}} from the lottery game.
</strong>

<p>
  In total, you earned {{payoff_so_far_money}} from the review questions, the investment game and the lottery game.
