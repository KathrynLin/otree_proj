  Recall that you must make decisions for all choices that you face
  before one of the decisions will be selected at random to determine your earnings.
</p>

<p>
  After you have made all decisions and one of these has been selected to be used,
  the program will generate a random number to calculate your earnings for the decision problem that turns out to be relevant.
  Now we will generate the random number that determines the throw of the 10-sided die
  in such a manner that each outcome, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 is equally likely.
</p>
<p>
  Your choice list is {{player.choice_list}}.
</p>

<div style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">
  <p>
    The decision chosen for payment is <span style="color: red;">{{decision_for_payment}}</span>. The corresponding choice is <span style="color: red;">{{choice_for_payment}}</span>.
    The random number that determines the throw of the 10-sided die is <span style="color: red;">{{die_num}}</span>.
    You earned <span style="color: red;">{{payment}}</span> from the lottery game.
  </p>
  <p>
    In total, you earned <span style="color: red;">{{payoff_so_far_money}}</span> from the review questions, the investment game and the lottery game.
